help¦about       Main task that the scripts perform is templating the '.env' and 'docker-compose.yml' files.\n\
All operations are working with text files and directories.\n\
The goal is to assemble various combinations of services from existing yml-templates.\n\
For this purpose, the concept of 'context' and 'service' is introduced.\n\
The service is represented by a yml-file describing a specific service (Docker-service).\n\n\
for example:\n\
+ file '.template/docker.compose/services/portainer.yml' — this is a file that can be included\n\
 \t in the final build 'docker-compose.yml' of the named context.\n\
+ file '.template/docker.compose.env/portainer.env' — a template with environment variables\n\
 \t for this service.\n\
+ file '.template/docker.compose/'\n\
\n\
A named context is simply a directory in the '.context'-folder containing customized yml-templates and env-files\n\
 — files are copied to this folder from directories with .template's\n\
 (commands: 'addCtxSrv', 'rmCtxSrv', 'disableCtxSrv' - commands for managing Docker services of the context)\n\
\n\
for example:\n\
+ '.context/test/.tmpl/*.tmpl' — jinja templates for assembling the final 'docker-compose.yml'\n\
+ '.context/test/.environ/*.env' — env files with environment variables for each named service\n\
\n\
The above files can be edited with a regular text editor and are used to build the two resulting files:\n\
+ '.context/test/.env'\n\
+ '.context/test/.docker-compose.yml'\n\
\n\
These are the main 'context' files that can be used to run services added to the context. \n\
(i.e. in the folder where yml & env files describe Docker services with customized settings)\n
